<h4 class="mb10" style="clear:both;">The Authority Behind My Diabetes Home</h4>
<p>My Diabetes Home was created by Anuj Bhargava, MD, MBA,CDE, FACP, FACE, an endocrinologist and founder of the Iowa Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center (www.iderc.org).</p>
<p>Dr. Bhargava has devoted his career to defeating diabetes and is passionate about helping people with diabetes live better lives. This passion developed years ago, after Dr. Bhargava watched his favorite uncle die from diabetes complications. "I was 14 and his death had a major impact on me," said Dr. Bhargava. "I also saw how hard it was for his family, especially his children. He was only in his 40s when he died of a heart attack, because he did not take care of his diabetes or his health." </p>
<P>My Diabetes Home is part of Dr. Bhargava’s ongoing mission to improve the health and lives of people affected by diabetes. In addition to Dr. Bhargava, My Diabetes Home is staffed by a team of other health care professionals, including registered dietitians, pharmacists and certified diabetes educators. </P>
